# Interview Resources

# Contributing to this list

I'm happy to discuss adding resources to this list, but one of my goals is to keep it lean. I find really large lists to be unapproachable. If you'd still like to recommend a resource, create an issue and I'll review it. Just a fair warning that I will be very discerning before adding things to the list!
